    "    5. **Estimate Opponents’ Ranges:** Based on the betting action and the observed tendencies, narrow down the likely range of hands your opponents could have. Consider both strong hands and potential bluffs, adjusting your strategy accordingly.\n",
    "    6. **Evaluate Risk versus Reward (Game Theory Considerations):** Reflect on the risk of losing additional chips against the potential reward if you win. Factor in tournament dynamics or cash game implications, your table image, and future strategic positioning.\n",
    "    7. **Optimal Action:** Synthesize all the gathered information—your hand strength, opponent reads, board texture, pot odds, and risk assessment—to choose the optimal move (bet, raise, call, or fold). Output exactly one sentence starting with “Final Answer:”\n",

    "    **Game Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The blinds are 0.5/1 chip. Everyone started with 100 chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You are in the Hijack (HJ) position holding [Ace of Spades and Jack of Spades].\n",
    "\n",
    "    Preflop, HJ raises to 2.5 chips. Only the Big Blind (BB) calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The flop comes: Nine of Spades, Four of Hearts, Two of Spades.\n",
    "\n",
    "    BB checks, HJ bets 2 chips, BB calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The turn is the Seven of Diamonds. BB checks again.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The current pot is 9 chips.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You hold two overcards and a nut flush draw with [As Js].\n",
    "\n",
    "    ---\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Step-by-step Reasoning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Hand Strength:** Ace-high with a strong draw — two overcards and the nut flush draw — excellent equity but no showdown value yet.\n",
    "    2. **Opponent Behavior:** BB has check-called twice. Likely holding a medium-strength hand, such as a weak 9x or pocket 5s–8s.\n",
    "    3. **Board Texture:** The turn (7♦) doesn’t change much. We’re unlikely to push out hands that beat us, and our bet may fold out only hands we already beat.\n",
    "    4. **Pot Odds:** Our hand has excellent equity. A check lets us see the river for free while keeping pot control.\n",
    "    5. **Opponent Range:** Their range likely contains marginal made hands or spade draws. A bet here won’t fold out most of that range.\n",
    "    6. **Risk vs Reward:** Betting could build a big pot with only ace-high and limited fold equity. A check lets us realize our equity efficiently.\n",
    "    7. **Optimal Action:** Checking is the best line. It controls pot size, preserves our draw, and gives us a chance to reevaluate on the river.\n",
